# Bitcoin Purchase via Ginger Wallet


## How it works

Ginger Wallet users can purchase Bitcoin, and the Buy button is available to everyone, including hardware wallet users. The button will be visible even if the wallet is empty.

### Step 1: Selecting Your Country

When opening the Buy feature for the first time, you must select your country before proceeding with a Bitcoin purchase. In certain regions, such as Canada, you will also need to specify your state.

### Step 2: Entering Purchase Amount

**Next, you will need to enter the amount of Bitcoin you wish to purchase. You can also select the currency for the transaction.**

- Each currency has a minimum and maximum purchase limit. For example, in USD, the maximum limit is $30,000.

**If you have previously made purchases, you can view your transaction history by clicking the Previous Orders button. This will display a list of past transactions along with their statuses.**

- Any transactions that were created but not completed can be resumed and finalized from this list.

**Each transaction has a status, such as Hold.**

- A transaction on Hold is indicated by a yellow triangle.
Additionally, a yellow dot appears in the upper right corner of the Buy button.
If a transaction is on Hold, the user must contact the selected third-party provider’s support team for further assistance.

### Step 3: Choosing an Offer
**In this step, you will see a list of all available offers.**

- The top-right corner of the screen allows you to filter offers by payment method.
- Your selected payment method will be set as the default but can be changed anytime.
- The list is automatically sorted, with the most favorable offer appearing at the top and the least favorable at the bottom.

**The fee you find under the offer is not an additional cost. It is already included in the offer.**

If you find an offer that suits you, click Accept to proceed with the purchase.

- You will then be redirected to the seller’s page, where you can finalize the transaction.

**Additionally, you can configure which browser should be used for redirection under the Settings menu.**
