# Bitcoin Sell via Ginger Wallet


## How it works

Ginger Wallet users can sell Bitcoin, and the Sell button is visible as long as there are available funds in the wallet.

### Step 1: Selecting Your Country

When using the Sell feature for the first time, you must select your country before proceeding with a Bitcoin sale. Once selected, you will not need to enter it again for future transactions.

### Step 2: Entering Purchase Amount

**Next, you need to enter the amount of Bitcoin you wish to sell. You can enter this amount in BTC or in a fiat currency such as USD.**

- Each currency has minimum and maximum selling limits. Additionally, you will need to specify the currency in which you want to receive the funds.

### Step 3: Choosing an Offer
**Once you proceed, you will see a list of available offers.**

- You can filter the offers by payment method using the option in the top-right corner of the screen.
- The list is automatically sorted from the most favorable to the least favorable offer.
- If you find an offer that suits you, click Accept to proceed.

### Step 4: Completing the Transaction

- After accepting an offer, follow the instructions on the provider’s page.
- At a certain point, you will receive a recipient address and the exact amount to send.
- Return to Ginger Wallet once you have both.
- Back in the Ginger Wallet interface, you can continue by clicking the Send button in the dialog. While you can also use the Send button on the home screen, we highly recommend using the one in the dialog, as it optimizes the sending process specifically for selling Bitcoin.

### Step 5: Viewing Transaction History

**By clicking the Previous Orders button, you can view a list of past transactions along with their statuses.**

Any incomplete transactions can be resumed and finalized from this list.

Each transaction has a status, such as Hold.

- A transaction on Hold is indicated by a yellow triangle, and a yellow dot will appear in the upper right corner of the Sell button.
- If a transaction is on Hold, users must contact the selected third-party provider’s support team for assistance.
