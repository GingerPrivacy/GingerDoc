# What is Anonset?

In Bitcoin, anonset (anonymity set) measures the level of privacy in a transaction by indicating how many potential sources a coin could have. A higher anonset means greater privacy, as it becomes harder to trace the transaction's origin. Privacy tools like CoinJoin increase the anonset by combining multiple users' transactions, making inputs and outputs indistinguishable.
