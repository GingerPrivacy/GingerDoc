# Why Ginger?

We live in a society reminiscent of Orwell's dystopian vision, where surveillance is pervasive, and your information is exploited to categorize and influence you. Bitcoin projects face increasing pressure to gather extensive data whenever possible.
This is why Ginger Wallet is designed as a zero-knowledge software. Its developers cannot collect any of your sensitive information. Your bitcoin transactions remain entirely your own business.
